## CodeBook Description

Information about the variables, the data, and any transformations or work performed to clean up the data.

## Source Data

Data and descriptions for the project sourced from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition database built from the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors.

## Data Set Information

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

## Attribute Information

For each record in the dataset it is provided: 

* Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleratio
* Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope
* A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables 
* Its activity label
* An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment

## Features

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are:

max(): Largest value in array  
min(): Smallest value in array  
sma(): Signal magnitude area  
energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values  
iqr(): Interquartile range  
entropy(): Signal entropy  
arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4  
correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals  
maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude  
meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency  
skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal  
kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal  
bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window  
angle(): Angle between to vectors  

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

gravityMean  
tBodyAccMean  
tBodyAccJerkMean  
tBodyGyroMean  
tBodyGyroJerkMean  

## Work Performed to Clean Data in This Project

1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
4. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
